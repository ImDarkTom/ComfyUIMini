## Requirements

### For PC (Hosting WebUI):

-   **ComfyUI**: Ensure ComfyUI is installed and functional (minimum v0.2.2-50-7183fd1 / Sep. 18th release).
-   **NodeJS**: Version _16.0.0_ or higher.
-   **Package manager**: Perferrably NPM as Yarn has not been explicitly tested but should work nonetheless.

### Mobile (Accessing WebUI):

-   **Browser**: Any modern browser with support for WebSocket.
-   **Network**: Connection to the same network as the hosting PC.

## Installation

1. **Download**

You can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/ImDarkTom/ComfyUIMini/releases) (more stable)
or clone the repository (more up-to-date).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImDarkTom/ComfyUIMini.git
cd ./ComfyUIMini
```

2. **Setup**
(a) Install script
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
(b) Or manually

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```


3. **Run the app**

```bash
npm start
```

> **Note**: You may experience a crash on first launch, this should be resolve by launching again.

You can change the ComfyUI url/port as well as the port the app runs on in the _/config/default.json_ file.

After sucessfully running you should see text along the lines of `Running on http://<local-ip>:<port>` in the console, put this url into any device on your network and you should be able to access the UI.

## FAQ

### **Q**: I can't import my workflow.

-   **A**: You need to save your workflow in API Format to be able to import it as regular saving doesnt provide enough information to list all available inputs. For a guide on how to enable this option see video [here](https://imgur.com/a/YsZQu83).

### **Q**: Can you access the WebUI outside of the local network?

-   **A**: Yes you can through the use of port forwarding, however this carries security risks as it will allow anyone to potentially connect to your WebUI. As the process of setting up port forwarding varies greatly depending on your internet service provider I am unable to give specific instructions, however you may be able to find help by seaching '_[your ISP] enable port forwarding_'.
